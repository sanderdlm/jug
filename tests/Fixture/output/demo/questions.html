  <h1>Real Conversation Questions</h1>
  <p class="description">Here are three sets of questions to spark real conversation with people. Each set will be more personal and require more depth than the last.</p>

  <p class="description">How do you start? Get together a group of friends or strangers and split into small groups (three to five people). You select someone else in your group to choose a random number (i.e., a number between 1 and 20 if there are twenty questions), then read them the corresponding question. They’ll answer it, and after they answer it, it’s their turn to select someone to answer the next question. I recommend that you spend thirty minutes on the first set, forty-five minutes on the second, and at least an hour on the third.</p>

  <p class="description">Make sure you establish a judgment-free zone. Be kind to each other. Some of these questions will get you out of your comfort zone, and while that’s part of the point, you should always be able to ask for a new question if you’d rather not answer the one you’re given. If someone asks you for a new question, respect their wish; don’t coerce them to answer the initial question, even as a joke. Vulnerability isn’t possible without trust.</p>
