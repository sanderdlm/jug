# Jug documentation

Welcome to the Jug documentation. Here you will find everything you need to know to get started with Jug.

The first two pages: [Getting started](getting-started.md) and [The `site` object](the-site-object.md) are must-reads to get a good understanding of how Jug works.

If you have any questions, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/sanderdlm/jug/issues)!
